This project is a MERN application with Passport utilizing Semantic UI for frontend styling. The Book Club allows authenticated users to query books through Google Books API. Users are able to create/edit profile, search/buy books on Google Play, create/delete personal discussion posts, like/dislike discussion (posts) from other users, delete personal discussion (posts), and save/delete books to bookshelf for later retrieval.

Future developments will allow linking to social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, ect.) and allow Book Club Members to interact with eachother to create meetups for book discussions.
